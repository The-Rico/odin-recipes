    <h3>Pork Chops with Mushrooms and Grape Tomatoes</h3>
    <p>This is a fairly quick and absolutely delicious way to have 
        very juicy, so-tender-you-can-cut-them-with-a-fork<br> pork chops. 
        I use boneless chops that are 1 1/2 to 2 inches thick for this 
        and keep the other sides simple;<br> it's great with baby red potatoes 
        or rice. I happened to have really great chops, and some fabulous 
        veggies<br> on hand so I kept the seasoning simple. I used a rather 
        strong Viognier for the wine, but you could use any good white. </p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>4 (1 1/2 inches thick) boneless pork chops</li>
        <li>1 pinch seasoned salt, or to taste</li>
        <li>1 pinch lemon-pepper seasoning, or to taste</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon olive oil</li>
        <li>1 cup white wine, divided</li>
        <li>½ cup water</li>
        <li>1 cup oyster mushrooms, pulled apart but not chopped</li>
        <li>½ green bell pepper, diced</li>
        <li>½ small onion, minced</li>
        <li>2 cloves garlic, minced</li>
        <li>½ cup grape tomatoes</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon butter</li> 
    </ul>
    <h3>Recipe</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Step 1</li> 

        Season pork chops with seasoned salt and lemon-pepper seasoning.
        <li>Step 2</li> 
        
            Heat olive oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add seasoned pork chops; cook until golden, 3 to 5 minutes per side. Pour 1/2 cup wine and water over the pork chops; bring to a simmer. Cook until chops are no longer pink in the center and most of the liquid has evaporated, 8 to 10 minutes. Transfer chops to serving plates.
        <li>Step 3</li> 
        
        Stir oyster mushrooms, green bell pepper, onion, and garlic into the skillet. Increase heat to high and cook, stirring often, until onion softens and all the liquid evaporates, 3 to 5 minutes. Add remaining 1/2 cup wine, tomatoes, and butter. Cook and stir until heated through, 1 to 2 minutes.
        <li>Step 4</li> 
        
        Serve mushroom and tomato mixture over pork chops.
        
    </ol>
